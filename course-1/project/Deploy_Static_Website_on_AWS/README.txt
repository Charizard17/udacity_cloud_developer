I deployed one of the my hobby project, a snake game, to AWS S3 Bucket for this project
Repo: https://github.com/Charizard17/snake

Here are the links to the website:

S3 bucket endpoint: http://my-s3-bucket-2206898.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

(since I deleted the bucket, links are broken)
